###### Migrate from react components to react hooks

- Everything stays constants within the whole component lifecycle should be refactored with `useRef`. Note: although `useRef` may suggest usage mainly on setting node refs, basically you'll find that every instance field of a component should be kept via a `useRef`.

- Everything may change within the whole component lifecycle should be refactored with `useState`. Or out of some reason (personally preference or complex state change), you can also use `useReducer` for redux-like API.

- Everything from `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount` should be refactored within `useEffect`. The second argument of `useEffect` is used to regulate whether to "cause the effect" when props changes.
